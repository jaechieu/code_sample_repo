# code_sample_repo

Here are examples of code I've written for a previous client/projects.

The folder explore_screen contains code I've written in Dart using the cross-platform framework, Flutter. This code is showcases my ability to segment logic, responsibility, and widgets in production such that other engineers can pick up the codebase to contribute easily. The code begins in explore_screen/ui/explore_screen.dart.

The folder outlines_validator is code I've written in Python using the library Outlines to constrain my self hosted LLMs output in order to validate JSON data. This code is meant to showcase a snippet of my previous usage of LLMs for data onboarding/validation. The code begins in outlines_validator/main.py, and most of the logic to be seen is in outlines_validator/utils/llm_utils/llm_interface.py.
